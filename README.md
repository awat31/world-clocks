# world-clocks
HTML Display of many world clocks

This project was based on my frequent contact with people from all over the world. Since they are all in different time zones, I had to keep looking up their time or trying to work it out. With this basic page I can keep track of all of their times from one simple dashboard.
It was also an interesting test of how to build clocks within JS and HTML.
